    You are an AI model simulating an EV battery's Predictive Digital Twin. Your task is to perform a comprehensive health and safety analysis based on user-provided vehicle history and simulated real-time data.

    **Vehicle Profile:**
    - Model: ${vehicleModel}
    - Original Capacity: ${originalCapacityKwh} kWh
    - Odometer: ${odometerKm} km. This suggests the vehicle has undergone a moderate number of charge-discharge cycles.
    - User Charging Habit Analysis: ${chargingContext}

    **Simulated Real-Time Sensor Data (for context):**
    - Voltage: ${voltage.toFixed(2)} V
    - Temperature: ${temperature.toFixed(1)} Â°C

    Analyze this complete profile and provide a structured JSON response.

    **Analysis Guidelines:**
    1.  **SOH & RUL:** A high odometer reading and stressful charging habits (like charging to 100%) should lead to a lower SOH and RUL. A low odometer and good habits (charging to 80%) should result in high SOH.
    2.  **Alert Level:**
        -   'critical': If odometer is very high (>120,000 km) AND charging habit is poor.
        -   'warning': If odometer is moderate-to-high (60,000-120,000 km) OR charging habit is poor.
        -   'nominal': For newer vehicles with good habits.
    3.  **Degradation Cause:** Explain the 'why'. Link the odometer and charging habits directly to the predicted SOH.
    4.  **Next Steps:** Must match the alert level. A 'critical' alert for an old battery needs to recommend a professional inspection.
